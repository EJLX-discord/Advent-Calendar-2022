**Advent Calendar Day 15**

Hi everyone. How's your year been? 

I'm so delighted to take part in this year's advent calendar event. I hope that you've been enjoying it too. Since I'm here in this language learning community, I'd like to write about my thoughts about learning a language. It’s a bit long (my enthusiasm has exploded), but I sincerely hope that you enjoy it.

I feel that language learning is analogous to life itself. Generally, our greatest motive for learning a foreign language is something abstract and uncertain, namely, "improvement" and "fluency". Likewise, our lives do not necessarily have a specific objective; we have to create or find one ourselves. Thus, in the process of both language learning and life, we, in general, have to face uncertainty. We have to face our future and create a pathway to it ourselves. 

But that's not something we can do with ease. We tend to be anxious by looking at the future. I have doubted the reason why I study English every now and then. I have wondered why I am here in this world in the first place. But such feelings bombarded me with anxiety like a tidal wave because I was facing the future, while I wasn’t emotionally prepared. 

They say you should "never look back and only go forward". This statement is sometimes true, but not always so. I think it's absolutely fine to look back into the past. I think the best way to move forward while retaining your confidence and mental stability is to focus on today and sometimes rely on your past for some comfort. Contrary to the future, the past is concrete. It is an immovable, substantial foundation that has helped shape who you are. It certainly helps you hold on to reality. It can help you refute the whispers of uncertainty that’s trying to hurt you. 
And I believe that languages are a symbol of the past, a fruit of the collective past of all humans that have existed on the Earth. Although I agree with the idea that languages are alive and changing day by day, the languages we have now are “the results” of human activities. They are the fruition of cultures that humans have developed. When you gaze into the world of a language itself, you gaze into something immovable. Something that strengthens your security. Open your favourite book. It’s a past packed inside pieces of paper. It’s a concrete, complete universe that helps with reducing the uncertainty that’s trying to hurt you. Focus on the language itself. Pore over the most mundane of a sentence, which, otherwise, you wouldn’t have cared about. That is one kind of meditation, isn’t it?

Whenever I was about to lose motivation to study English, I reminded myself of my essential passion towards the English language itself. Therefore I appreciated the past to go further towards the future. My fundamental love of language studies is what keeps me going after almost 15 years of learning English. This fundamental love has made me want to do research on the Japanese language when I enter college. The fundamental love is the biggest factor that made me decide to take up Spanish. Learning Spanish helped me rediscover the fascinations in the enormous world of the English language. 

Contrarily, when I tried to keep myself motivated by setting a practical goal, I became strangely vulnerable to anxiety. Striving to attain good results in a speech contest or studying hard to prepare for Eiken and IELTS conversely put my motivation into danger. I was trying to look into the uncertainty, the future, although I wasn’t ready.

So, I can articulate from my experience that we don’t always have to face the future. We are allowed to look back and turn back. We are allowed to look for comfort within the immovable, concrete past. And when we’re ready, we can move forward. We are living today, not the future, even a small portion of which we never get to know. I can say the same for language learning. An IELTS test or a JLPT examination that’s coming up later cannot define you or evaluate who you are. Chasing the abstract “proficiency” or “fluency”——something similar to an illumination——may frustrate you when you’re not confident and prepared. Striving too hard to achieve your practical goal might make you burnt out. Instead, why don’t you focus on today every day and sometimes take a rest in the wonderful world of the past, namely, the world of language where endless fascinations and discoveries energise you? That might not count towards “being positive” by the general standards, but that will certainly help you go further. The past is your friend. The past is your greatest partner to fight against uncertainty with. And languages are the symbol of our past. Thus, languages are your best friends.

Thank you for reading. Congrats for making it to the end of this long long writing. Have a happy Christmas time.

Cheers.
