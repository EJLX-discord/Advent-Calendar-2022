<a:ejlx:590758402066743296>  @❄️Advent Calendar 2022 32 submissions later, we have finally reached the end of the 6th annual EJLX Advent Calendar! <a:agoogletada:635256497525358592>
Now all 32 participants have something to look back on and reminisce about the memories and thoughts they shared, and see the progress they have made on their language learning journey.
I'd like to thank everyone who participated, read the submissions and offered corrections, your efforts made this a great event! <:YotsubaPray:569638326701654019>
Special thanks to @ESPAlchemist「Super Panama World」, @ayumminu and @松雄芭蕉🍌🌸 for their help in organizing everything <:yotsubaDogeza:832958332725624894>
This channel is going to be archived and the colorful roles deleted some time in late January. While archived, the channel will remain accessible to everyone.
All submissions are soon going to be available on our archive page too (https://ejlx-discord.github.io/Advent-Calendar-Hub/)
See you in December 2023! <a:bcaPatientlyWaiting:764167633234559016>
